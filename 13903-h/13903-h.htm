    <h2>MORE DISCIPLINE.</h2>

    <p>"Yes, Sir," said Sergeant Wally, accepting one of my
    cigarettes and readjusting his wounded leg,&mdash;"yes, Sir,
    discipline's the thing. It's only when a man moves on the word
    o' command, without waiting to think, that he becomes a really
    reliable soldier. I remember, when I was a recruit, how they
    put us through it. I'd been on the square about a week. I was a
    fairly smart youngster, and I thought I was jumping to it just
    like an old soldier, when the drill sergeant called me out of
    the ranks. Look 'ere,' he said, 'if you think you're going to
    make a fool o' me, standing about there till you choose to obey
    the word o' command, you've made a big mistake.' I could 'a'
    cried at the time, but I've been glad often enough since for
    what the sergeant said that day. I've found that little bit of
    gag useful myself many a time."</p>

    <p>I was meditating with sympathy upon the many victims of
    Sergeant Wally's borrowed sarcasm when he spoke again.</p>

    <p>"When I first came up to London from the depôt," he said,
    "I'd a brother, a corporal in the same battalion. You know as
    well as I do, Sir, that as a matter o' discipline a corporal
    doesn't have any truck with a private soldier, excepting in the
    way of duties, and my brother didn't speak to me for the first
    week. Then one day he called me up and said, 'It ain't the
    thing for me to be going about with you, but as you're my
    brother I'll go out with you to-night. Have yourself cleaned by
    six o'clock.'</p>

    <p>"Well, I took all the money I'd got&mdash;about twelve
    bob&mdash;and off we went.</p>

    <p>"We had a bit o' supper first at a place my brother knew of,
    and a very good supper it was. My brother ordered it, but I
    paid. Then we got a couple of cigars&mdash;at least, I did.
    Then we went to a music-hall, me paying, of course. We had a
    drink during the evening, and when we came out my brother said,
    'We'd better come in here and have a snack.'</p>

    <p>"'Well, I ain't got any money left,' I sez. My brother
    looked at me a minute, and then he said, 'I don't know what
    I've been thinking of, going about with you, you a private and
    me a corporal. Be off 'ome !' And he stalks away.</p>

    <p>"Yes, Sir, discipline's the thing. Thank you, I'll have
    another cigarette."</p>

            <p>Purring as hard as tiger-cats at play purr</p>

            <p class="i6">A pretty piece of acting,</p>

    <h2>AN EXTRA SPECIAL.</h2>

    <p>A special constable is allowed to bore his beat-partner in
    moderation. I have no doubt that I bore mine. In return I
    expect to be moderately bored. In fact a partner who flashed
    through all the four hours might attract Zeppelins. But Granby!
    In human endurance there is a point known as the limit. That is
    Granby.</p>

    <p>Years back some Government person in a moment of fatuity
    made Granby a magistrate. Magistrates should learn to condense
    their wisdom into sentences. Granby beats out his limited store
    into orations.</p>

    <p>It was my misfortune to arrive late at the station the other
    night and to find that the other specials had craftily left
    Granby to be my partner. The results of unpunctuality are
    sometimes hideous.</p>

    <p>Directly we had started our lonely patrol Granby gave what I
    may describe as his "bench" cough and began, "When I was at the
    court the other day a very curious case came before me." He was
    off. If Granby delivers to prisoners in the dock the speeches
    he recites to me the Government ought to intervene. No man
    however guilty ought to have a sentence <i>and</i> one of
    Granby's orations. He might be given the option. Personally,
    for anything under fourteen days I should be tempted to serve
    the sentence.</p>

    <p>Just when he was at his dreariest I heard a remarkable
    treble voice down a side-street singing, "Keep the Home Fires
    Burning." "Sounds like a drunk," I said promptly; "we ought to
    investigate this." Had it been a couple of armed burglars I
    should have welcomed their advent if it stopped Granby.</p>

    <p>We went down and found a stout lady sitting on the pavement
    warbling Songs Without Melody.</p>

    <p>"Gerout, Zeppelin," she observed as a flash-lamp was turned
    on her.</p>

    <p>"A distinct case of intoxication <i>plus</i> incapability,"
    observed Granby. "We must take her to the station. You can
    charge her. I have so many important engagements this week that
    I can't spare time to be a witness."</p>

    <p>I saw that a wasted morning at the police-court was to be
    thrust on me.</p>

    <p>"I also have many important engagements this week," I
    replied.</p>

    <p>"This duty is to be taken seriously&mdash;" began
    Granby.</p>

    <p>"Yes," I said, "if we don't run her in we ought to see her
    home. She can't stay here rousing the street."</p>

    <p>"That was what I was about to suggest as the proper course
    for you when you interrupted me," said Granby. "Where do you
    live?" he demanded.</p>

    <p>"Fourteen, Benbow Avenue," replied the lady; "and pore Uncle
    Sam's been dead eleven years."</p>

    <p>"Come on," I said. "Get up and we'll see you home."</p>

    <p>The lady pushed me aside, gripped Granby's arm and said
    affectionately, "'Ow you remind me of pore ole Jim in 'is best
    days afore 'e got jugged!"</p>

    <p>Granby snorted as he dragged the lady onward. I think he
    knew that I was smiling in the darkness.</p>

    <p>"Jus' like ole times, when we was courtin' together,"
    continued the lady. "If it 'adn't been for a bronze-topped
    barmaid comin' between us, what might 'ave been! ah, what might
    'ave been!"</p>

    <p>This tender reminiscence prompted the lady to sing, "Come to
    me, sweet Marie," with incidental attempts at a step-dance. The
    <i>finale</i> brought us to Benbow Avenue.</p>

    <p>"I shall speak to her husband and caution him severely about
    his wife's conduct," said Granby to me.</p>

    <p>I shrank into the background ready to move off directly the
    oration began.</p>

    <p>Granby knocked at the door and it opened.</p>

    <p>"I have brought your wife home in a state&mdash;" he
    began.</p>

    <p>"Ain't I 'ad a nice young man to take me for a walk while
    you've been sitting guzzling by the fire?"</p>

    <p>"You been taking my missis for a walk," said the indignant
    husband.</p>

    <p>"I am a magistrate and a special constable&mdash;" began
    Granby.</p>

    <p>"More shame to you. It's the likes of you 'oo disgraces the
    upper clarses."</p>

    <p>"Shut the door, Bill," said the lady. "Don't lower yourself
    by talking to 'im. I never could abide a man as smelt o' gin
    meself."</p>

    <p>The door slammed and Granby strode towards me.</p>

    <p>"The ingratitude of the lower classes is disgraceful. I am
    tempted to despair of the State when I think of it. The only
    way is to let these occurrences pass into oblivion, to set
    oneself resolutely to forget them as if they had never
    been."</p>

    <p>I agreed; but since then Granby has always eyed me
    curiously. I think he suspects that I am not forgetting
    resolutely enough.</p>

    <h2>THE WATCH DOGS.</h2>

    <h3>LIV.</h3>

    <p>My Dear Charles,&mdash;What about this Peace? I suppose
    that, what with your nice new Governments and all, this is the
    very last thing you are thinking of making at the moment. I
    wouldn't believe that the old War was ever going to end at all
    if it wasn't for the last expert and authoritative opinion I
    hear has been expressed by our elderly barber in Fleet Street.
    At the end of July, 1914, he told me confidentially, as he
    snipped the short hairs at the back of my head, that there was
    going to be no war; the whole thing was just going to fizzle
    out. Now he says it is going to be a very, very long business,
    as he always thought it would.</p>

    <p>I find it difficult to maintain consistently either the
    detached point of view, in which one discusses it as if it was
    a European hand of bridge, or the purely interested point of
    view, in which one regards it only as a matter affecting one's
    individual comfort. I know a Mess, well up in the Front where
    they measure the mud by feet, in which they were discussing the
    War raging at their front door as if it had nothing to do with
    them beyond being a convenient thing to criticise. Men who were
    then likely to be personally removed at any moment by it saw
    nothing in the progress of it to be depressed about. As the
    evening wore on and they all came to find that they knew much
    more about the subject than they supposed, they were prepared
    to increase the allowance of casualties in pressing the merits
    of their own pet schemes. No gloom arose from the possibility
    that this generous offer might well include their own health
    and limbs. There was no gloom; there was even no desire to
    change the subject. Indeed, the better to continue it they
    called for something to drink. There was nothing to drink,
    announced the Mess Orderly. Why was there nothing to drink?
    asked the Mess President, advocate of enormous offensives on a
    wide front for an indefinite period of years, if need be. The
    Mess Orderly explained that more drink was on order, it had not
    arrived because of difficulties of carriage. Why were there
    difficulties of carriage? Because of the War. "Confound the
    War," said the Mess President. "It really is the most infernal
    nuisance."</p>

    <p>I know a Captain Jones, resident a cottage on the road to
    the trenches (he calls this cottage his "Battle Box"), whose
    mind was very violently moved from the impersonal to the
    personal point of view by a quite trifling incident. He has one
    upstairs room for office, bedroom, sitting, reception and
    dining room. His meals are brought over to him by his servant
    from an estaminet across the road over which his window looks.
    The other morning he was standing at this window waiting for
    his breakfast to arrive. It was a fine frosty day, made all the
    brighter by the sound of approaching bagpipes. Troops were
    about to march past, suggesting great national thoughts to
    Jones and reminding him of the familiar details of his own more
    active days. Jones prepared to enjoy himself.</p>

    <p>Colonels on horses, thought Jones as he contemplated, are
    much of a muchness&mdash;always the look of the sahib about
    them, the slightly proud, the slightly stuffy, the slightly
    weather-beaten, the slightly affluent sahib. Company
    Commanders, also on horses, but somehow or other not quite so
    much on horses as the Colonels, are the same all the army
    through&mdash;very confident of themselves, but hoping against
    hope that there is nothing about their companies to catch the
    Adjutant's eye. The Subaltern walks as he has always done,
    lighthearted if purposeful, trusting that all is as it should
    be, but feeling that if it isn't that is some one else's
    trouble. Sergeants, Corporals, Lance-corporals and men have not
    altered. The Sergeants relax on the march into something almost
    bordering on friendliness towards their victims; the Corporals
    thank Heaven that for the moment they are but men; the
    Lance-corporals thank Heaven that always they are something
    more than men, and the men have the look of having decided that
    this is the last kilometre they'll ever footslog for anybody,
    but while they are doing it they might as well be cheerful
    about it. The regimental transport makes a change from the
    regularity of column of route, and the comic relief is
    provided, as it has always been and always will be provided
    whatever the disciplinary martinets may say or do, by the
    company cooks.</p>

    <p>This was a sight, thought Jones, he could watch for ever. He
    was sorry when the battalion came at last to an end; he was
    glad when another almost immediately began. He was in luck;
    doubtless this was a brigade on the move. He proposed to have
    his breakfast at the window, when it came as come it soon must,
    thus refreshing his hungry body and his contemplative mind at
    the same time. The second battalion, as the first, were fine
    fellows all, suggesting the might of the Allies and the
    futility of the enemy's protracted resistance. Again the comic
    relief was provided by the travelling cuisine, reminding Jones
    of the oddity of human affairs and the need of his own meal,
    now sufficiently deferred.</p>

    <p>The progress of the Brigade was interrupted by the
    intervention of a train of motor transport. Jones spent the
    time of its passing in consulting his watch, wondering where
    the devil was his breakfast and ascertaining that his servant
    had indeed gone across the road for it at least forty minutes
    ago.</p>

    <p>It was not until there came a break, after the first company
    of the third battalion, that the reason of this delay became
    apparent. There was his servant on the far side of the road,
    and there was his breakfast in the servant's hand, all standing
    to attention, as they should do when a column of troops was
    passing....</p>

    <p>The remainder of that Brigade suggested no agreeable
    thoughts to Captain Jones. He saw nothing magnificent in the
    whole and nothing attractive in any detail of it. It was in
    fact just a long and tiresome sequence of monotonous and
    sheeplike individuals who really might have chosen some other
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page5"
       id="page5"></a>[pg 5]</span> time and place for their silly
       walks abroad. And as for the spirit of discipline
       exemplified in the servant, who scrupled to defy red tape
       and slip through at a convenient interval, this was nothing
       else but the maddening ineptitude of all human conceits.</p>

    <p>A wonderful servant is that servant of Captain Jones; but
    then they all are. Valet, cook, porter, boots, chambermaid,
    ostler, carpenter, upholsterer, mechanic, inventor,
    needlewoman, coal-heaver, diplomat, barber, linguist
    (home-made), clerk, universal provider, complete pantechnicon
    and infallible bodyguard, he is also a soldier, if a very old
    soldier, and a man of the most human kind. Jones came across
    him in the earlier stages of the War, not in England and not in
    France. The selection wasn't after the usual manner or upon the
    usual references. He recommended himself to Jones by the
    following incident:&mdash;</p>

    <p>A new regiment had come to the station; between them and the
    old regiment, later to become the firmest friends, some little
    difference of opinion had arisen and, upon the first meeting of
    representative elements in the neighbouring town, there had
    been words. Reports, as they reached Jones at the barracks some
    four miles from the town, hinted at something more than words
    still continuing. Jones, having reason to anticipate sequels on
    the morrow, took the precaution of going round his company
    quarters then, and there, to find which of his men, if any,
    were not involved. "There's a fair scrap up in town," he heard
    a man saying. As he entered, a second man was sitting up in bed
    and asking, "Dost thou think it will be going on yet?" Hoping
    for the best, he was for rising, dressing, walking four miles
    and joining in.</p>

    <p>Jones stopped his enterprise that night, but engaged him for
    servant next day. I don't know why, nor does he; but he was
    right all the same. Yours ever, HENRY.</p>

    <h2>LONDON'S LITTLE SUNBEAMS.</h2>

    <h4>THE TAXI-MEN.</h4>

    <p>What (writes a returned traveller) has happened to London's
    taxi-drivers? When I went away, not more than three months ago,
    they occasionally stopped when they were hailed and were not
    invariably unwilling to convey one hither and there. But now
    ... With flags defiantly up, they move disdainfully along, and
    no one can lure them aside. Where on these occasions are they
    going? How do they make a living if the flag never comes down?
    Are they always on their way to lunch, even late at night? Are
    they always out of petrol? I can understand and admire the
    independence that follows upon overwork; but when was their
    overwork done? The only tenable theory that I have evolved is
    that Lord NORTHCLIFFE (whose concurrent rise
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page7"
       id="page7"></a>[pg 7]</span> to absolutism is another
       phenomenon of my absence) has engaged them all to patrol the
       streets in his service.</p>

    <p>Sometimes, however, a taxi-driver, breaking free from this
    bondage, answers a hail; but even then all is not necessarily
    easy. This is the kind of thing:&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>You</i>. I want to go to Bedford Gardens.</p>

    <p><i>The Sunbeam</i> (<i>indignantly</i>). Where's that?</p>

    <p><i>You</i>. In Kensington.</p>

    <p><i>The Sunbeam</i>. That's too far. I've got another job at
    half-past four (<i>or</i> My petrol's run out).</p>

    <p><i>You</i>. If I gave you an extra shilling could you just
    manage it?</p>

    <p><i>The Sunbeam</i> (<i>scowling</i>). All right. Jump
    in.</p>

    <p>This that follows also happens so frequently as to be
    practically the rule and not the exception:&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>You</i>. 12, Lexham Gardens.</p>

    <p><i>The Sunbeam</i>. 12, Leicester Gardens.</p>

    <p><i>You</i>. No; LEXHAM.</p>

    <p><i>The Sunbeam</i>. 12, Lexham Road?</p>

    <p><i>You</i> (<i>shouting</i>). No; Lexham GARDENS!</p>

    <p><i>The Sunbeam</i>. What number?</p>

    <p><i>You</i>. TWELVE!</p>

    <p>To illustrate the power that the taxi-driver has been
    wielding over London during the past week or so of mitigated
    festivity, let me tell a true story. I was in a cab with my old
    friend Mark, one of the most ferocious sticklers for efficiency
    in underlings who ever sent for the manager. His maledictions
    on bad waiters have led to the compulsory re-decorating of half
    the restaurants of London months before their time, simply by
    discolouring the walls with their intensity. Well, after
    immense difficulty, Mark and I, bound for the West, induced a
    driver to accept us as his fare, and took our places
    inside.</p>

    <p>"He looks a decent capable fellow," said Mark, who prides
    himself on his skill in physiognomy. "We ought to be there in a
    quarter of an hour."</p>

    <p>But we did not start. First the engine was cold. Then, that
    having consented and the flag being lowered, a fellow-driver
    asked our man to help him with his tail-light. He did so with
    the utmost friendliness and deliberation. Then they both went
    to the back of our cab to see how our tail-light was doing, and
    talked about tail-lights together, and how easy it was to jolt
    them out, and how difficult it was to know whether they had
    been jolted out or not, and how jolly careful one had to be
    nowadays with so many blooming regulations and restrictions and
    things.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile Mark was becoming purple with suppressed rage, for
    the clock was ticking and all this wasted time should, in a
    decently-managed world, have belonged to us. But he dared not
    let himself go. It was a pitiful sight&mdash;this strong man
    repressing impulse. At any moment I expected to see him dash
    his arm through the window and tell the driver what he thought
    of him; but he did not. He did nothing; but I could hear his
    blood boil.</p>

    <p>Then at last our man mounted the box, and just at that
    moment (this is an absolutely true story) it chanced that an
    errand-boy asked him the way to Panton Street, and he got down
    from the box and walked quite a little way with the boy to show
    him. And while he was away the engine stopped. It was then that
    poor Mark performed one of the most heroic feats of his life.
    He still sat still; but I seemed to see his hat rising and
    falling, as did the lid of WATT's kettle on that historic
    evening which led to so much railway trouble, from strikes and
    sandwiches to <i>Bradshaw</i>. Still he said nothing. Nor did
    he speak until the engine had been started again and we were
    really on our way and thoroughly late. "If it had only been in
    normal times," he said grimly, "how I should have let that man
    have it. But one simply mustn't. It's terrible, but they've got
    us by the short hairs!"</p>

    <p>No doubt of that.</p>

    I, my brothers and sisters, as I'm proud to call you, <i>we</i>
    don't spout, do we? We mean business! <i>And PHILIP means
    business too</i>! At any moment he may come down on us and
    devastate our quiet picturesque little demes which we all love
    so well and get disgustingly drunk on <i>our</i> wine. So give
    us the word, ÆSCHINES AND Co.&mdash;not many words, please, but
    just <i>one</i> word&mdash;and we'll tackle him as he ought to
    be tackled and put a pinch of Attic salt on his tail. We don't
    want <i>this</i> PHILIP, but we <i>do</i> want a fillip of our
    own. Meanwhile, are we downhearted? I <i>don't</i> think.</p>

    <h2>THE ONLY REGRET.</h2>

    <h4>ONCE UPON A TIME.</h4>

    <p>Once upon a time a man lay dying.</p>

    <p>He was dying very much at his ease, for he had had enough of
    it all.</p>

    <p>None the less they brought a priest, who stretched his face
    a yard long and spoke from his elastic-sided boots.</p>

    <p>"This is a solemn moment," said the priest. "But sooner or
    later it comes to us all. You are fortunate in having all your
    faculties."</p>

    <p>The dying man smiled grimly.</p>

    <p>"Is there any wrong that you have done that you wish
    redressed?" the priest asked.</p>

    <p>"None that I can remember," said the dying man.</p>

    <p>"But you are sorry for such wrong as you have done?"</p>

    <p>"I don't know that I am," said the dying man. "I was a very
    poor hand at doing wrong. But there are some so-called good
    deeds that I could wish undone which are still bearing evil
    fruit."</p>

    <p>The priest looked pained. "But you would not hold that you
    have not been wicked?" he said.</p>

    <p>"Not conspicuously enough to worry about," replied the
    other. "Most of my excursions into what you would call
    wickedness were merely attempts to learn more about this
    wonderful world into which we are projected. It's largely a
    matter of temperament, and I've been more attracted by the
    gentle things than the desperate. Strange as you may think it,
    I die without fear."</p>

    <p>"But surely there are matters for regret in your life?" the
    priest, who was a conscientious man, inquired earnestly.</p>

    <p>"Ah!" said the dying man. "Regret? That's another matter.
    Have I no occasion for regret? Have I not? Have I not?"</p>

    <p>The priest cheered up. "For opportunities lost," he said.
    "The lost opportunities&mdash;how sad a theme, how melancholy a
    retrospect! Tell me of them."</p>

    <p>"I said nothing about lost opportunities," the dying man
    replied; "I said that there was much to regret, and there is;
    but there were no opportunities that in this particular I
    neglected. They simply did not present themselves often
    enough."</p>

    <p>"Tell me of this sorrow," said the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page11"
       id="page11"></a>[pg 11]</span> priest. "Perhaps I may be
       able to comfort you."</p>

    <p>The dying man again smiled his grim smile. "My greatest
    regret," he said, "and one, unhappily, that could never be
    remedied, even if I lived to be a thousand, is&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Yes, yes," said the priest, leaning nearer.</p>

    <p>"Is," said the dying man, "that I have known so few
    children."</p>

    <h2>CHOKING THEM OFF.</h2>

    <p>It is reported that, should the measures recently adopted by
    the railway companies with a view to "discourage unnecessary
    travelling" prove insufficient, other expedients, of a more
    stringent character, may be resorted to. By the courtesy of an
    official we are able to give details of some further
    innovations that have been suggested.</p>

    <p>(I.) The Platform Staff at the chief stations will be
    specially trained to answer all enquiries from civilian
    passengers in an ambiguous or quasi-humorous manner.</p>

    <p>Thus detailed instructions are to be issued giving the
    correct form of reply to such questions as, "Can I take this
    train to Rugby?" The answer in this case will convey a jocular
    suggestion that the task is best left to the engine-driver; and
    others in the same style.</p>

    <p>In all cases of urgency the formula "Wait and see" to be
    freely employed for purposes of discouragement.</p>

    <p>(II.) In the case of exceptionally popular tickets, such as
    those to Brighton, a strictly limited number of impressions to
    be struck off, which will be disposed of by public auction to
    the highest bidder.</p>

    <p>(III.) When stoppages (whether necessary or disciplinary)
    take place between stations, preference to be given to the
    interior of tunnels. All artificial light will then be cut off,
    and the officials of the train will run up and down the
    corridors howling like wolves.</p>

    "Fac-simile of a typical week-end bill at the Hotel Superb,

    <h2>TACTICS.</h2>

    <p>"Maman! à quel saint prie-t-on&mdash;" began Jeanne. Ah! but
    no, a recollection flashed across her mind and was reinforced
    by other memories. "J'en ai fini avec les saints," she mused,
    proceeding to the other end of the room where, full of
    intention, she busied herself among some books. Yes, she was
    now quite disillusioned; that latest blow, on her recent tenth
    birthday, had confirmed finally her long-growing
    suspicion&mdash;prayer to the saints was unavailing.</p>

    <p>After a time; "Maman, pour que Papa vienne en permission à
    qui faut-il que l'on s'adresse?"</p>

    <p>"A son colonel, mon enfant. Mais, ma fi-fille, tu
    sais...!"</p>

    <p>Jeanne, with an air of having something to decide for
    herself, paid no heed, but resumed the study of her
    picture-book description of the French Army, murmuring: "Un
    colonel&mdash;est-ce que c'est comme un saint, ou bien est-ce
    que c'est comme le bon Dieu lui-même?"</p>

    <p>Some moments of deep silence spent in intense study ended
    with a triumphant: "Bon! j'y suis." That was exactly what she
    had wished to discover, the very source of power. "'Les
    officiers attachés à un général pour l'exécution et la
    transmission de ses ordres,'" re-read Jeanne, and commented,
    "Et tout cela s'appelle l'<i>é-tat ma-jor</i> du général. Bon!
    c'est bien comme je le pensais; c'est le général qui est à la
    tête de tout."</p>

    <p>Her course was now quite clear. She urged and encouraged
    herself: "Il faut absolument que Papa vienne en permission.
    <i>Je&mdash;le&mdash;veux!</i>" And, that her intentions might
    not be thwarted, absolute secrecy must be maintained, at least
    in so far as the chapter relating to her terrestrial tactics
    was concerned; no one would oppose intercession <i>auprès du
    bon Dieu</i>.</p>

    <p>"Il faut m'adresser à tous les deux en même temps,"
    pronounced Jeanne, taking a sheet of note-paper. "J'écris
    directement au général" (since time and space have to be
    allowed for in earthly negotiations, the order must be
    thus)&mdash;"et je prie le bon Dieu en personne." That both
    positions should be assailed simultaneously, operations must be
    begun in this quarter in the morning, at the hour of the first
    postal delivery.</p>

    <p>"Point de saints, ni de colonels&mdash;maintenant je
    comprends&mdash;l'<i>é-tat-ma-jor</i> dans l'Armée et les
    saints au Paradis, c'est tout comme!"</p>

    <h2>AT THE PLAY.</h2>

    <h4>"PUSS IN NEW BOOTS."</h4>

    <p>Five hours is a great space out of a man's life, but that
    was precisely the time taken by Mr. ARTHUR COLLINS to present
    his <i>Puss in New Boots</i>, so that I had leisure to study
    the book of the words, sold shamelessly to the unsuspecting (of
    whom I was not one), and compare the rough sketches of our
    three standard authors of the Lane, Messrs. COLLINS, SIMS and
    DIX with the version, by no manner of means final, of the
    comedians. A pantomime book is on the whole rather a mournfully
    unsubtle document. The thing is frankly not meant to be read
    when the blood is cool. It is the Action, Action and again
    Action of such hefty knock-abouts as WILL EVANS, ROBERT HALE
    and STANLEY LUPINO that makes the dry bones live and the old
    squibs crackle. And it is good fun to watch the audience at
    their share of authorship, setting the seal of their approval
    upon the happy wheeze, the well-contrived business, and
    blue-pencilling with their silence the wash-out or the too
    obscure allusion.</p>

    <div class="figright"

        <a href="images/14.png"><img width="100%"

             alt="DIANA OF THE LANE." /></a>

        <h4>DIANA OF THE LANE.</h4><i>The Baroness</i> ... Mr.
        ROBERT HALE.
    </div>

    <p>The show is substantially new throughout&mdash;new songs,
    new scenery, new japes, new acrobatics. A new Puss, too, as
    well as new boots; and, without any reflection on little Miss
    LENNIE DEANE, who was quite an adequate Puss of pantomime, we
    may regret Miss RENÉE MAYER.</p>

    <p>Miss FLORENCE SMITHSON still delights the curious with her
    Swedish exercises in alt, and makes a very pretty lady of high
    degree for a pantomime marquis, who is no other than Miss MADGE
    TITHERADGE stepping down from the "legitimate" and bringing an
    air and an elocution unusual and admirable. She made her
    excellent speaking voice do duty in recitative for song, and
    the innovation is not unpleasing. If it be fair in frivolous
    public places to dig down to those thoughts that better lie too
    deep for tears, Mr. ALFRED NOYES' <i>A Song of England</i>,
    clear spoken by her with tenderness and spirit, is a better
    instrument than most.</p>

    <p>Mr. HALE's <i>Baroness</i> challenges comparison with Mr.
    GEORGE GRAVES's. She is perhaps more womanly ("no ordinary"
    type), less grotesquely irrelevant and profane&mdash;though she
    does her bit. On the other hand, she is more active and less
    repetitive. When, the good fairy endowing her with beauty, she
    appeared as DORIS KEANE in <i>Romance</i>, that was an
    applauded stroke. And when she lied beneath the tree of truth
    and the chestnuts fell each time truth was mishandled, thickest
    of all when it was asserted that a certain Scotch comedian had
    refused his salary, this was also very well received. On the
    whole, then, a satisfactory Baroness.</p>

    <p>Mr. LUPINO (the miller's second son) is really an exquisite
    droll, and I don't remember to have seen him in better form. He
    has some of the authentic ingredients of the old circus
    clown&mdash;a very valuable inheritance.</p>

    <p>Mr. WILL EVANS is always good to watch, always has that air
    of enjoying himself immensely that is the readiest way to
    favour. He seemed at times to be, as it were, looking wistfully
    for his old pal, GRAVES; missed probably that companionable
    nose and those reliable <i>da capos</i> which give such
    opportunity for the manufacture of gags; whereas Mr. HALE is a
    "thruster." But cooking the <i>recherché</i> dinner in the gas
    cooker that becomes a tank, and putting up the blind and laying
    the carpet&mdash;here was the WILL EVANS that the children of
    all ages applaud.</p>

    <p>I always find the Lane big scenes and ballets more full of
    competing colour and restless movement than of controlled
    design. But the Hall of Fantasy, with its spiral staircases
    reaching to the flies, was an ambitious effort crowned with
    success. The dance of the eight tiny zanies was the best of the
    ballet. The Shakspearean pageant at the end might be (1)
    shortened, and (2) brightened by the characters throwing a
    little more conviction into their respective
    aspects&mdash;notably the ghost of <i>Hamlet's</i> father.
    However, as a popular tercentenary tribute to "our Shakspeare"
    the scheme is to be commended and was as such approved.</p>

    <h2>THE SPIRITUAL SPORTSMAN.</h2>

    <blockquote class="note">
        <p>[The Executive of the German Sporting Clubs and Athletic
        Associations have issued a manifesto expressing
        satisfaction at the substitution of German for English
        words and phrases. "German sport," it declares, "in future
        places itself unreservedly on the side of those who would
        further German Kultur. German Song and German Art will in
        future find a home in German sport." This new patriotic
        programme has been greatly applauded in the Press, the
        <i>Berliner Tageblatt</i> observing that the culture of
        soul and body must proceed <i>pari passu</i>, with the
        result that "not only will the German sportsman become a
        beautiful body, but a beautiful soul as well. Every club
        must have its library, not filled with sensational novels,
        but with works of art. And before all else the club-house
        must be architecturally beautiful&mdash;an object from
        which he may obtain spiritual edification."]</p>

    <h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</h4>

    <p>Miss ETHEL SIDGWICK (long life to her as one of our optimist
    conquerors!) still keeps her preference for the creation of
    charming people and her rare talent for making them alive. But
    I wonder if she is not refining her brilliant technique to the
    point of occasional obscurity of intention. At least I know I
    had to re-read a good many passages to be quite sure what was
    in fact intended. An implied compliment, no doubt; but are all
    readers so virtuous? ("or so dull?" quoth she).
    <i>Hatchways</i> (SIDGWICK AND JACKSON) is one of those happily
    comfortable, just right houses with a hostess,
    <i>Ernestine</i>, whom everybody loves and nobody (save her
    husband, and he not in this book) makes love to. Holmer, on the
    other hand, is the adjoining ducal mansion with a distinctly
    uncomfortable dowager still in command who can't even arrange
    her dinner-parties and fails to marry her sons to the right
    people. Perpetually Hatchways is wiping the eye of Holmer, and
    this touches the nerve of the great lady. Her sons,
    <i>Wickford</i>, the authentic but hardly reigning duke, and
    <i>Lord Iveagh Suir</i>, the queer impressionable (on whom the
    author has spent much pains to excellent effect), both take
    their troubles to <i>Ernestine</i>. And a young French aviator
    (this is a pre-War story), guest at Hatchways, analyses and
    discusses situations and characters from his coign of
    privilege&mdash;a device adroitly handled by the discreet
    author, who adds two charming girls, coquette <i>Lise</i>,
    <i>Iveagh's</i> first love, and wise, loyal, perceptive
    <i>Bess</i>, whom he found at last. To those who appreciate
    subtle portraiture let me commend this study.... I feel just as
    if I had been for a long week-end at Hatchways, anxiously
    wondering, as I write my "roofer," if I shall be so lucky as to
    be asked again.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>I think there is little doubt that you will agree with me in
    calling <i>The Flaming Sword</i> (HODDER AND STOUGHTON) as
    noble and absorbing a story of fine work finely done as any
    that the War has produced. It is the history, told by herself,
    of Mrs. ST. CLAIR STOBART's Red Cross Mission "in Serbia and
    Elsewhere." The frontispiece, Mr. GEORGE HANKIN's moving
    picture of <i>The Lady of the Black Horse</i> (a name always to
    be honoured among our Allies), catches the spirit of the heroic
    tale and prepares you for what the <i>Lady</i> herself has to
    tell. Mrs. STOBART is no sentimentalist; fighting and the
    overcoming of obstacles are, one would say, congenial to her
    mettle; time and again, even in the midst of her story of the
    terrible retreat, with the German guns ever thundering nearer,
    she can yet spare a moment to strike shrewdly and hard for her
    own side in the other struggle towards feminine emancipation
    which is always obviously close to her heart. Certainly she has
    well earned the right to be heard with respect. Read this
    high-spirited account of the difficulties&mdash;mud, disease,
    prejudice, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page16"
       id="page16"></a>[pg 16]</span> famine&mdash;through which
       the writer brought her charge triumphantly to safety, and
       you will be inclined, with me, to throw your critical cap
       into the air and thank Heaven for such women of our race,
       which would be to invite, not unsuccessfully, some withering
       snub from the very lady you were endeavouring to praise. But
       that can't be helped. Meantime of her exploit and the book
       that recounts it I can sum up my verdict in the only Serbian
       that I have gleaned from its pages&mdash;<i>Dobro,
       Dobro!</i> For a translation of which you know where to
       apply.</p>

    <p>So many battle books have been pouring from the press lately
    that it is difficult to keep pace with them, and harder still
    to find something fresh to say of each; but <i>quot homines

    concern lies more especially with the New Zealand Forces and
    their campaigns I can very safely recommend a volume which the
    official war correspondent to that contingent and his son have
    jointly published under the title of <i>Light and Shade in
    War</i> (ARNOLD). Whether it is Mr. MALCOLM ROSS who supplies
    the light, and Mr. NOEL ROSS the shade, or <i>vice versa</i>,
    we are given no means of ascertaining. Between them they have
    certainly put together an agreeable patchwork of small and
    easily read pieces, most of which have already appeared in
    journalistic form. It is perhaps parental prejudice that makes
    Mr. Punch consider the best of the bunch to be "Abdul," one of
    three slight sketches that originally saw the light in his own
    pages. <i>Abdul</i> is a joy, also a thief, a society
    entertainer, and a Cairo hospital orderly. I can only hope that
    the story of how he displayed his patient's sun-browned knees
    as a raree show to the convulsed G.O.C. and lady, who were
    visiting the hospital, is at least founded on fact. The
    publishers are entirely justified in saying that these
    impressions, made often under actual fire, have both colour and
    intimacy. So I wish them good luck in the campaign for popular
    favour.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p><i>François Villon, His Life and Times</i> (HUTCHINSON) is
    one of those fortunate volumes that arrive to fill a long
    vacant corner. So far as I know, with the exception perhaps of
    STEVENSON's study, there has been no means by which the casual
    reader, as apart from the student, could correct his probably
    very vague ideas about the Father of Realism. Mr. H. DE VERE
    STACPOOLE, approaching the subject not for the first time, here
    essays a brief life and appreciation of the poet, told in
    picturesque but simple style. Sometimes indeed the simplicity
    is apt to appear overdone, so that one gets a suggestion that
    the story is being presented to us in thoughts of one syllable.
    Apart from this, however, there is much to be said for Mr.
    STACPOOLE's vivid reconstruction of mediæval France, and the
    Paris that sheltered VILLON himself, TABARY, MONTIGNY and the
    others&mdash;that group of shadows whom we see only by the
    lightning of genius. They and their contemporaries pass before
    us here like a pageant woven upon tapestry. Occasionally indeed
    Mr. STACPOOLE looks suddenly round the tapestry, even (one
    might say) tears a hole in it and pushes his head through, with
    a startling effect. But as he has always the good excuse of
    sympathy with his subject one easily forgives him these
    generous impulses. As I said before, a book that has had its
    place long reserved.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>If you happen to remember that most excellent book,
    <i>Brother-in-Law to Potts</i>, you may recall that the
    principal motive in it is the spiritualising influence of a
    certain Lady Beautiful, very lightly and even intangibly
    presented, on the lives of some other persons of a more
    material clay. In <i>Obstacles</i> (CHAPMAN AND HALL), Mrs.
    "PARRY TRUSCOTT" has returned to her previous subject, but with
    the notable difference that she now traces the influence
    brought in turn to bear upon the lady herself, who emerges from
    her semi-divine obscurity to become the heroine of the story.
    If in her background sketch of the munitions factory where
    <i>Susannah</i> elects to work the writer does not trouble much
    about technical detail or even attempt to suggest any
    particular acquaintance with such matters as lathes or shell
    bodies, yet she does convey, with striking simplicity and
    naturalness, the impression of a world at war, and for the rest
    she is content to bring her heroine in contact with the lives
    that are to affect her and the environment of comparative
    poverty that is to help her to a decision. What that decision
    was, and how unnecessary too, is sufficiently indicated if I
    say that she was blessed with most understanding parents, who
    positively preferred that her suitor should be a poor man. And
    so the happy future that surely no authoress and most certainly
    no male reader could have the heart to refuse to so delightful
    a <i>Susannah</i> is available to complete a picture touched
    throughout with singular grace and charm. In particular the
    little snap-shots of two ideal family households, the one that
    includes the heroine, and another, much humbler, which she
    enters as an honoured guest, go to make this volume, all too
    short though it is, one that I can recommend with quite unusual
    pleasure and confidence.</p>

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
